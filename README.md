# tAc-tIc-O
Welcome to tAc-tIc-O! The classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe with the addition of AI! 

#I began this project during my Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course in spring 2024. Currently the project is able to play a tic-tac-toe game using 3 board sizes (3x3, 4x4, and 5x5) with the use of Artificial Intelligence via the minimax function. In the future I hope to finish implementing the score board feature as well as introduce the negamax algorithm.
